# 🧠 ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (ABSA)

A two-stage pipeline for **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**, designed to extract opinion targets and classify sentiments at a fine-grained level.

---

## 🎯 TASK OVERVIEW

### 🔍 Task 1: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)
Identify **opinion targets (aspects)** in a sentence.

### 🎯 Task 2: Aspect Sentiment Classification (ASC)
Predict **sentiment polarity** (**positive**, **negative**, **neutral**, **conflict**) for each extracted aspect.

---

## 💡 MOTIVATION

Traditional sentiment analysis gives a single label to a sentence, but real-world reviews often express **multiple sentiments for different aspects**.

#### 🧾 Example:
> *"The food was excellent, but the service was disappointing."*  
> → `food` → ⭐️ **positive**  
> → `service` → ❌ **negative**

🔍 **ABSA** offers **fine-grained insights**, critical in domains like:
- Restaurant reviews
- Product analysis
- Customer feedback
